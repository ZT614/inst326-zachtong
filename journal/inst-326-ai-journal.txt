Week 1
This week, I used ChatGPT to provide an example of using .find(). I was
able to understand this Python function more, as I have not used it before.

I also used another AI model, DeepSeek, to find careers related to information science,
such as data, IT, and cybersecurity. This gave me an opportunity to look at the different
job titles these fields offer, which was fascinating.

Week 2
This week, I used Google Gemini to explain finding indexes within lists. This was helpful
for me in getting a refresher on the concept. Just for comparison's sake, I asked ChatGPT the same question. 
I was not surprised that the AI gave pretty similar answers. Both of these models gave a broad overview
of the concept and dove into the technical explanations.

Week 3
This week, I used ChatGPT to give me an example of tuples. I think it did a good job of
providing a basic one and the components of a tuple. I haven't dove deep into tuples whenever 
I learned Python in the past, so this was good to get a better understanding of the concept.

I also asked ChatGPT to give me an example of the concept of docstrings. 
I have not encountered or used docstrings before, so this was helpful
in letting me know the benefits and when it is approriate to use them.

Outside of schoolwork, I used DeepSeek to give me a list of music recommendations to add to my
Spotify playlists, specifically ones that focused on hip-hop because that is my favorite genre. 
As someone who is a big music fan, the list that the AI gave me was really good. 
It was separated by era and mood, which was interesting. Some of the albums on the list
were ones that I have never heard from beginning to end, so that makes me excited to
give them a listen.

Week 4
I used ChatGPT to provide me an example of a basic class. This allowed me to
get a better understanding of what it is and how it is useful in Python.
I liked how it went over each part of the class, so I don't get confused.

I also used ChatGPT to give me ideas on functions for the team project.
Honestly, I did not think it did a good job. Some of them were decent, but
most of them were a bit too complicated to understand, even with the
provided explanations.

Week 5
I used Google Gemini to give me an example of encapsulation. The AI gave
an example of a bank account. Even though it mentioned the methods that 
were used, I thought that it didn't go super in-depth in the code. Also, 
it did not mention which attributes should be considered private or public. 

I also asked ChatGPT to explain the difference between getter and setter
methods. This was helpful in knowing the concept in a simpler way.
