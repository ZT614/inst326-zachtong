Week 1
This week, I used ChatGPT to provide an example of using .find(). I was
able to understand this Python function more, as I have not used it before.

I also used another AI model, DeepSeek, to find careers related to information science,
such as data, IT, and cybersecurity. This gave me an opportunity to look at the different
job titles these fields offer, which was fascinating.

Week 2
This week, I used Google Gemini to explain finding indexes within lists. This was helpful
for me in getting a refresher on the concept. Just for comparison's sake, I asked ChatGPT the same question. 
I was not surprised that the AI gave pretty similar answers. Both of these models gave a broad overview
of the concept and dove into the technical explanations.

Week 3
This week, I used ChatGPT to give me an example of tuples. I think it did a good job of
providing a basic one and the components of a tuple. I haven't dove deep into tuples whenever 
I learned Python in the past, so this was good to get a better understanding of the concept.

I also asked ChatGPT to give me an example of the concept of docstrings. 
I have not encountered or used docstrings before, so this was helpful
in letting me know the benefits and when it is approriate to use them.

Outside of schoolwork, I used DeepSeek to give me a list of music recommendations to add to my
Spotify playlists, specifically ones that focused on hip-hop because that is my favorite genre. 
As someone who is a big music fan, the list that the AI gave me was really good. 
It was separated by era and mood, which was interesting. Some of the albums on the list
were ones that I have never heard from beginning to end, so that makes me excited to
give them a listen.

Week 4
I did not use AI for this week.
